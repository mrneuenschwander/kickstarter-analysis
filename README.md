# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
This Project is the end result of the first 6 lessons of Module 1, including this repository. 

Contained within is a full analysis of various kickstarter campaigns conducted around the world. It will help to highlight certain trends with a specific focus on the musical theater and play datasets, and show the most likely way to get a project funded in a given market. There will be visual guides, as well as fully sortable charts to further refine youe search.

The Results will break down a variety of categories, such as this table that shows the success of all the datasets within: ![Pivot Chart 1 3 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116296092/199546974-13451e56-57a5-4900-bfd4-2204367d825d.png) and ![Pivot Table 1 3 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116296092/199547842-78e2d9e9-ec8e-480c-8c7d-fc4f930a4bf3.png). The first shows success rates in the file as a whole, the second shows theater campaigns in particular based on the month they launched.

It would seem the middle of the year is ideal for launching a fundraising campaign, likely due to summer travel and people wanting to go see live entertainment. Leveraging this will add to the campaign's success. In addition, the GB camapign that was discussed is lilkely to be produced for less than the target budget of Â£4,000. This will increase overall profit and revenue/overhead.
