# Kickstarting with Excel
Week 1 Project

## Overview of Project
This analysis is intended to proide a window into the marketing and completion rates of various kickstarter campaigns across a range of years. Primarily, it is focused on the success of theater outcomes based on their launch dates, and funding success rates of an overseas campaign concerning Great Britain in particular.

### Purpose
To show the launch dates and costs of camapigns that are likely to garner the most success in their given sphere. It does no one any good to launch a campaign in a market that doesn't want it, and this report will help the Client to avoid certain pitfalls that could otherwise be a problem if not accounted for.

## Analysis and Challenges
The full analysis is wide-ranging, but does primarily consider the Theater category, as that is what the Client requested. It drills into a few favorites: <img width="837" alt="Top_Plays_Edinburgh" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116296092/200142262-9bbcbb4b-f588-422d-be6d-b77c33cc02a6.png"> 

as well as a full list of successful US Campaigns that could provide further insight into the following section's report, and more: <img width="1243" alt="Successful US Theater Campaigns" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116296092/200142325-1010c369-adab-4f84-a277-928e24e53235.png"> 
Difficulties encountered were primarily with the new functions, but in-system diagnostics and documentation, in addition to online sources, greatly lessened time lost to them. Other difficulties that are likely to be encountered include loss of data organization to incorrect formatting (as the dataset is large and does not integrate radical changes well), and occasionally crashing due to volume. Issues from both of these can be mitigated with manual saving on completion of a section, and confirmation of data placement when creating a new formula or PivotTable to be used in reporting.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The first conclusion we can draw regarding launch dates is that late spring into the early part of summer is the best time to launch a fundrasing campaign for a theater production. ![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116296092/200142743-a05e5580-e76d-4c13-a632-f5f21bb8a3e3.png)
It could be inferred that this is due to summer approaching, and the availibility and/or popularity of outdoor venues (such as the one is Tuacahn, UT, US) goes up significantly. The second is that theater campaigns as a whole are more successful than campaigns across other media: ![Campaign_Success_Rates](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/116296092/200143110-2ffe0011-0071-4b4c-856c-9029ecb9ec1a.png)
and that is already a more positive outlook than if an attempt was being made to launch a technology campaign, for example. Currently, there are no live campaigns in the tech section, whereas the Theater and others have not only live campaigns, but better success rates as a whole.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
